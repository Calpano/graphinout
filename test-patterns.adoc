**AAA Parser and Converter: Design and Testing Strategy**

This document outlines the components and testing methodology for a system designed to parse *AAA* format files into an intermediate *CJ* representation and convert them back.

'''

== 1. Components

=== 1.1. AAA-to-CJ Parser
A parser will be developed to read text files in the *AAA* syntax. This parser will process the input and generate an in-memory or stream-based representation, designated as *CJ*.

=== 1.2. CJ-to-AAA Converter
A converter will be created to take a *CJ* document (or stream) as input and generate a corresponding text file in the *AAA* syntax as output.

=== 1.3. AAA Normalizer
Due to technical constraints, a direct round-trip conversion (stem:[AAA \rightarrow CJ \rightarrow AAA]) does not produce a file that is byte-for-byte identical to the original.

To facilitate accurate testing, a *normalizer* utility is required. This tool will read any file in *AAA* format and output a "canonical" version of it. This canonical syntax ensures that two semantically identical *AAA* files will produce an identical output file after normalization.

'''

== 2. Testing Plan

The system will be validated using a two-phased testing approach.

=== 2.1. Phase 1: Parser Stability Test
Objective::
Ensure the *AAA-to-CJ Parser* is robust and can handle all valid *AAA* files without crashing.

Procedure::
. Feed the entire corpus of existing *AAA* files to the parser.
. Monitor the parser for any crashes, unhandled exceptions, or processing failures.

Success Criteria::
* The parser successfully processes all files without critical errors.

=== 2.2. Phase 2: Round-Trip Conversion Test
Objective::
Verify that the full conversion pipeline (stem:[AAA \rightarrow CJ \rightarrow AAA]) preserves the semantic integrity of the data.

Procedure::
. *Input:* Select an original file (+original.aaa+).
. *Parse:* Use the *AAA-to-CJ Parser* to convert the file:
+
+original.aaa+ → +intermediate.cj+
+
. *Convert:* Use the *CJ-to-AAA Converter* to convert it back:
+
+intermediate.cj+ → +roundtrip.aaa+
+
. *Normalize:* Use the *AAA Normalizer* on *both* the original and the round-tripped files:
** +original.aaa+ → +original.canonical.aaa+
** +roundtrip.aaa+ → +roundtrip.canonical.aaa+
. *Compare:* Perform a file comparison (e.g., +diff+) on the two canonical outputs.

Success Criteria::
* The two canonical files (+original.canonical.aaa+ and +roundtrip.canonical.aaa+) must be identical.
