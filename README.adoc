= graphinout: graph in -> graph out
:gio: graphinout

* Convert between graph formats
* Validate GraphML

== Purpose

Graphinout reads many common graph file formats and converts them losslessly to a common format: *GraphML*.

There are many graph toolkits, graph databases and graph-based apps, which all implement their importers and map incoming graph to their internal APIs.
As there are so many variants of graphs and even more kinds of internal APIs, there is no "common Java graph API" in sight.
Instead, {gio} just reads all kinds of formats and converts them to a common graph file format, *GraphML*.

.Benefits
App developers:: of graph-related software can focus on core features.
Need only to read *GraphML*.
Converter developers:: easy to add more input formats
Users:: can re-use their existing data effortlessly using almost any format their data producing software writes.

== Features

* Written in modern Java (17).
* Parses input and either converts to valid GraphML file, or
* Shows comprehensible validation errors.
* Easy to integrate into existing software.

.Non-Features
* Java graph API
* Convert relational data (CSV, Excel, databases) into graphs

=== Output Format

* link:src/main/doc/graphml.adoc[GraphML] (<- our notes about the format)

Writing other formats could be a nice _future_ extension.
This would turn {gio} into the 'https://pandoc.org/[pandoc] of graph file formats'.

Triple based::
Triples (semantic web) can be encoded themselves as XML or text-based syntaxes.
They are used for knowledge graphs, vocabularies, linked open data and ontologies.
Common file types:

* Turtle (text-based, `.ttl`)
* RDF/XML (XML-based, `.rdf.xml`
* N3 (text-based, `n3`)
* N-Triples (text-based, `nt`)
* Web Ontology Language (XML-based, `.owl.xml`)
* BioPAX (OWL-based) BioPAX (Biological PAthways eXchange) Format http://www.biopax.org/[spec]

== Usage

Command line::
{gio} can be used on the command line to read format X and write to GraphML.

Library::
{gio} can be used as a Java library to read format X and write to a GraphML file or `Writer`.

== Introduction to Graphs

A graph is first a mathematical concept.
As it turns out, it is rather a family of concepts.
A good introduction into the general idea can be found in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory[Wikipedia on Graph Theory].
In computer science, a graph is an abstract data type, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)[Wikipedia].
An exhausting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory[glossary of graph theory] explains all terms with a special meaning in a graph context.

.Graph vs. Graph File Format
NOTE: Don't confuse graph file format features with graph features.
Graph features such as a __cycle-free graph__ do not depend on the file format.
Graph features depend on the kind of data stored *in* a graph file format.
A graph file format needs to be able to represent e.g. directed graphs.
All formats which do can represent cycle-free directed graphs as well as graphs with cycles.
There are many, many graph concepts, which are not required to understand or even know when converting graph input data is your job.

== Graph File Format Features

- undirected graphs
- directed graphs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph[Wikipedia]
- mixed graph: mix of directed and undirected edges
- self-loops: An edge from a node A to itself
- parallel edges aka multi-edges: Multiple edges from a node A to another node B
- edge attributes (e.g. type of edge or weight)
- node attributes (e.g. type of node or weight)
- hyper-graphs: edges with more than 2 endpoints
