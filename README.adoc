= graphinout: graph in -> graph out

* Convert between graph formats
* Validate GraphML

== Purpose
Graphinout reads many common graph file formats and converts them to a common super-set.
We use GraphML as the common format.

== Features
* Written in modern Java.
* Parses input and either converts to valid GraphML file or
* shows comprehensible validation errors.

== Graph Format Features
- directed vs undirected graphs
- mixed graph: mix of directed and undirected edges
- self-loops: An edge from a node A to itself
- parallel edges aka multi-edges: Multiple edges from a node A to another node B

A great 2015 paper on graph file formats: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02781.pdf[]
including links to graph data repositories -- time frames indicate when the format was/is used
