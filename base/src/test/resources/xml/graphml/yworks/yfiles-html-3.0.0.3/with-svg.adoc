This is an interesting bug.

The file `with-svg.graphml.xml` causes errors when parsing.
Even the much simpler `with-svg-SIMPLER.graphml.xml` fails to be parsed.
Surprisingly, the even simpler `with-svg-SIMPLER2.graphml.xml` works correctly.

So it seems the excessive number of namespace declarations triggers a bug in the Java XML SAX parser.

Most of theses namespace are not used anyway and not other tool besides the yFiles for HTML 3.0.0.3 was found writing that many namespaces.
So we just marked the file as invalid XML for now.
